The x-13 files in this directory were compiled for my own home and work computers and are unlikely to work on your particular system, even if you too are running Mac OS.

Binaries for Windows and Linux/Unix are available from https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/.

To compile X-13 for Mac OS X, see the instructions here: https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/wiki/Compiling-X-13ARIMA-SEATS-from-Source-for-OS-X. Good luck.
